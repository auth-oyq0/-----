    <p style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(255, 203, 222);">
        Known for their heavily forested terrain and rugged hiking trails, 
        the Appalachian Mountains, also known simply as the Appalachians,
        are a system of mountain ranges that stretch some 1,500 miles (2,400 km) south to
        north from the U.S. state of Alabama to the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. - Peak Visor

    <p style="page-break-before: always">
        While the geologic definition of the Appalachian Mountains does not technically include the hills in Mississippi,
        it does include some of the mountains within the Canadian provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. 
        The Canadian Appalachians are often considered a distinct system of ranges, 
        though this is a geopolitical distinction rather than a geological one

    <p style="font-family: Arial">
        Geography of Appalachian-Mountains - The Appalachians formed a natural barrier between the eastern Coastal Plain and the Interior Lowlands of North America, playing a vital role in the development of the United States. For over a century, they were the critical barrier to the westward expansion of the British colonies.
        "Appalachia" often refers to a distinct cultural region stretching from southern New York through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. However, it has a different definition in a geological context as a mountain range.
        Geologically, the range is part of at least 16 states, including all the previously mentioned states plus Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
